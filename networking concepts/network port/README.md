Let's say, you are browsing on your web browser. At the same time, you are listening to music on spotify and chatting with your friend. Your web browser, music application and chat application send and receive data from internet. Your pc has only one connection to internet, all data is sent and received with this single connection. So when data is received, how do we know which application should use this data. We need some sort of identifier - this is what port does. Any service that need to connect to network, bind to a port, data packets that are being transmitted also have port number, operating system forward data packets to network services.
